                            Not sure where to start? Step-by-step HTML and CSS for 
                            Absolute Beginners is a comprehensive and friendly course designed for beginners

                                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the building blocks of the web. 
                                If you've ever looked at a website, you've seen HTML and CSS in action!
                            </li>

                    <p>
                        My name is Tim, and I've been teaching technology to beginners 
                        under the ABC Learing Center! since 2009. 
                        I believe that with the right approach, anyone can learn anything.

                            an intuitive understanding of how HTML and CSS work.
                        </strong>
                        In this course, we'll create a simple "Coming Soon" webpage

                        I'll explain WHY the code we write looks the way it does. 
                        I'll point out the simple patterns in the code, 
                        so you can learn more quickly and with more confidence.
